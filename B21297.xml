            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT On the behalf of William Dockwra, Merch<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Concerning the PENNY-POST.</head>
            <p>VVHereas the said <hi>Dockwra</hi> did above Nine Years since at his Sole Charge, first set up, that New and Useful <hi>Invention</hi> of the <hi>Penny-Post,</hi> so universally approved, and well known to be a Great and Publick good. He was most unjustly deprived thereof, by the Power of the late King <hi>James,</hi> when Duke <hi>of</hi> York, under Colour of Law, and kept out of Possession in the late Reigns, without any manner of Reparation to this Day; as appears more fully by his Case lately Printed.</p>
            <p>Therefore finding himself obliged, for Vindication of his just rights, and in order to the Reparation of his great damages; to make Address to the Parliament for Relief, he did accordingly exhibit his humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, to the Honourable House of Commons, and upon Reading of the same there, it was Unanimously referr'd to the <hi>Commitee</hi> of the whole <hi>House,</hi> for considering the Publick Revenue.</p>
            <p>Soon after, some Unnamed Person, did Print, and Disperse a Paper, which he call'd; <hi>An answer to</hi> Mr. <hi>Dockwra's Case concerning the</hi> Penny-Post: wherein, by citeing Part only of the <hi>Post-Office</hi> Statute, and asserting several untruths, and by frameing a Tryfling Parallel, between the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Penny-Post</hi> (but leaving out the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>terial, and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ential Parts of the Practice, wherein they are utterly disagreeable and inconsistent) he put the whole Case in a False Light, and as much as in him lay, used his Talent towards the justifying of those Illegal and Arbitrary Proceedings, under which the said <hi>Dockwra</hi> with his Family of a Wife, and Eight Children, have been so many Years oppressed.</p>
            <p>The Design of which Paper, bespeaking the Author, to be a Man of as little Sense, as good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The said <hi>Dockwra</hi> is well satisfied the present Governour of the <hi>General-Post-Office,</hi> had no hand therein; as knowing his Abilities too great, and (believing his Ingenuity and Justice) to be far above thoughts so low, and attempts so malicious.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the said <hi>Dockwra,</hi> had prepared a <hi>Reply</hi> to that pretended <hi>Answer,</hi> which he had by him ready to wash off the Varnish of that Officious Undertaker, and solidly to Evince to the Parliament his Legal Title to this <hi>New Invention</hi> (never known or practised in the World before) and to expose the wicked Practices that were made use of to Divest him thereof, (after he had spent so many Years time, and so many Thousand Pounds just to bring the <hi>Penny-Post</hi> to Perfection) and having Dutifully attended the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> to that End. The Parliament adjourned, before the Revenue was settled; so that the said <hi>Dockwra</hi>'s Case came not on to a Hearing this Session, for which Reason, he did not think fit to Print his <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But finding since the Adjournment of the Parliament, the same sort of Papers have been thrown into <hi>Coffee-houses</hi> and other Places, and Care taken, Industriously to spread false reports about Town, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Issue of the said <hi>Dockwra</hi>'s Petition, which may beget undue Impressions.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Dockwra</hi> thinks it Incumbent upon him, to Advertise the Publick hereby, that he has not met with any sort of Discouragement from the Parliament in his Application to them for Relief: But on the contrary, hath found an Honourable and Universal Countenance therein, and doubts not (at the next meeting of the Parliament) but that he shall receive from their great Wisdom and Justice, such Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Reparation for his Sufferings, and such due Reward for the Publick Service he hath done his Countrey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s will be not only to his intire satisfaction, but to their <hi>Eternal Honour.</hi>
